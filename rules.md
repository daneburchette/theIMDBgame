# The IMDb Game

## Rules (3 Players)

The game consists of 10 rounds, arranged in three sets of 3 rounds each,
followed by a final 10th round with slightly different rules.

### Normal Rounds

In each normal round, one player is selected as the **Active Player**. All
players are presented with a movie, including:

- Its title and year of release
- Notable cast members
- A short description

The Active Player then guesses the movie’s IMDb rating (to the nearest tenth of
a point). After that, the other two players guess whether the **actual score is
higher or lower** than the Active Player’s guess.

Once all guesses are in:

- Players who guessed correctly (higher/lower) earn **1 point** each.
- Players who guessed incorrectly earn **1 point each for the Active Player**.
- If the Active Player guessed the exact score, he earns **3 bonus points**.

The role of Active Player rotates each round so all players get a turn. For each
new set of 3 rounds:

- **Set 2:** Points are doubled from Set 1
- **Set 3:** Points are tripled from Set 1

### Final Round (Round 10)

In the final round, all players submit their guesses **in secret**, without a
designated Active Player. Whoever is **closest to the actual IMDb score** wins
the round.

In the event of a tie for closest, the points go to the closest without going
over ('Price is Right' style).

Points awarded in this round are **arbitrarily high**, making the first 9 rounds
largely irrelevant — because that’s funny.
